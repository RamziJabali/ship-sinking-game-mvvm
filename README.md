# Sink the Ship Game
In my CSC110 Intro to Java class, I was tasked in doing a sink the [sea ship game.](https://github.com/RamziJabali/CSC110-intro-to-java/tree/master/assignment-4-sea-game) In looking at industry standards of development, I found the Model, View, View Model ([MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)) a standard. I took the time to read up on it and redo the project using the pattern accordingly.
